# Another start at a grab-n-go boilerplate

My first attempts at Typescript. I'm sure I'm doing it wrong!

My goal is to have something with the configuration and setting all ready to go, so I can get right down to the business.

For some reason, this almost never works. But it's a good exercise none the less!

I'll be refineing this and using it as a jump off point for a small project I'm hopeful about. 

Enjoy at your own risk!
